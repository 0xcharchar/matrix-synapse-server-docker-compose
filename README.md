# Matrix Synapse Server Docker Compose Setup
This is a docker compose setup with a synapse-data file already setup with some arbitary keys and yaml file.

!!! NOTE: Yes I do have keys in here, it makes setup easier and as I am only running them locally it doesnt matter. **DO NOT USE THESE FOR PRODUCTION**. !!!

## Requirements
- Docker

## Setup
- `make dev-run`

Refer to `make help` for other options.
